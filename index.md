Back when I was a Computer Science student,
stuck in my stress & sadness...
I just wished I could *kill* my emotions,
represented here as a fat gecko named Sticky.

Why couldn't I be more like Spock or Sherlock?
I'd be so much more efficient without all these darn *emotions* in the way.

A lot of my friends felt that way, too.
So I started studying Psychology.
Maybe it'd teach me how to crush my irrational self...
and be a rational machine.

First, I learnt the basics of the brain.
It's far more complicated in reality, of course,
but let's pretend that brain cells follow one, simple rule:

**"Cells that fire together, wire together."**

![INTERACT - play with hebb's](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/play_hebb.jpg)

This is known as [Hebb's Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory). While it doesn't explain all about our *human* brains, it does explain a lot about our *lizard* brains: instinct, intuition, and that bothersome thing called emotion.

![PIC - human/lizard brain](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/brain_1.jpg)

Now that you know how the lizard brain learns, you'll get to perform one of the most famous experiments in psychology! Yup. Right here, right now.

**Sticky drools when it sees food. Teach it to drool, instead, at the sound of a bell.**

![INTERACT - pavlov](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/play_pavlov.jpg)

You may have immediately recognized that as the Pavlov's Dog experiment! Except here, you could read the animal's mind. The kind of teaching you just did to Sticky is called **classical conditioning**, where one learns to associate one sensation with another.

![PIC - Pavlov]()

But after I read about that in my Psych textbook, I realized... oh crap, this whole time, I've been conditioning myself to *hate doing what I love*.

![INTERACT - burnout](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/burnout_1.jpg)

That's burnout. I accidentally associated what I loved (Computer Science) with what I hated. (feeling tired, hungry, alone) No, no, it's okay. Now that I knew, maybe I could reprogram myself? Maybe...

![INTERACT - recondition](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/burnout_2.jpg)

It took some time, but it worked. My inner Sticky stopped rebelling, and in fact, started cheering me on! All I had to do was to take care of my basic needs, and make a *deliberate effort* to associate my work with positive things, so I could love doing what I love.

Or as I put it in my diary...

![PIC - Life Lesson: Don't push yourself, pull yourself.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/life_1.jpg)

But I remained suspicious of Sticky. I was still a constant emotional wreck, and obviously, the *logical & rational* thing to do was blame an imaginary gecko inside my head.

![PIC - human/lizard brain, ME, NOT-ME](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/brain_2.jpg)

So, I went back to my Psych book. Next, I learnt about another famous psychology experiment, which you'll also get to re-enact now! This time, Sticky doesn't merely react to things - Sticky takes *action*.

**Teach Sticky to pull the lever, but NEVER to push the button.**

![INTERACT - skinner](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/play_skinner.jpg)

Now Sticky knows -- pull, not push.

That was a variant on the Skinner Box experiment. What you did to Sticky is called **operant conditioning**, finding that you could shape behavior with reward & punishment. And don't worry, Skinner was just the name of the scientist... not a description of what the box does to animals.

![PIC - I'm Not Drawing That](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/nope.jpg)

And again, I realized operant conditioning had a lot to do with all the bad habits I'd accumulated over the years... years of not taking good care of my inner Sticky.

     <last minute edit - removing this part, see footnote>

It was one of my most destructive bad habits. I am not proud of this.

![INTERACT - Self-destructive. I'm Not Drawing That. Catharsis](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/catharsis_1.jpg)

Catharsis doesn't work. Psychologists have known this for decades, but this poisonous myth still persists, so it's worth saying again. **Catharsis doesn't work.** You're not *releasing* bad emotions, you're *rehearsing* them.

But now I knew. And again, I could *work* with Sticky, to break bad habits, and form better ones.

![INTERACT - Channeling](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/catharsis_2.jpg)

Old habits die hard, but they *can* die. Habits have three stages: cue, routine, reward. What I did was kept the same cue, (anger) kept the same reward, (self-expression) but replaced the routine with something healthier. (channeling my stress & sadness into stories... like the one you're reading right now.)

My diary had a snappier summary:

---

You know what's funny? Pavlov & Skinner thought we were merely programmed with conditioning - *emotional machines*. But I wanted to get rid of my emotional self, and just be a *rational machine*.

I finally realized - I am not a machine. I'm *two* of them.

![ANIM - Brain thing, with actual info. system 1 & system 2. A big one. associative to logical](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/systems.jpg)

And shame on me for trying to kill half of myself.

. . .

A lot of my friends wanted - some *still* want - to be all rationality and no emotion. It's a common desire.

![ANIM - t-rex 1: relax on grass, around peeps](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/end_1.jpg)

I don't blame them. When you're drowning in sorrow, I know it's tempting to wanna rid yourself of all emotions... I know.

![ANIM - t-rex 2: chat w friends](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/end_2.jpg)

But please - don't ignore or fight your emotions, work *with* them. Emotion isn't illogical, it just speaks in a different *kind* of logic. You can learn its language.

![ANIM - t-rex 3: hug it out w big sticky](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/end_3.jpg)

. . .

If you took away anything from this essay, please let it be *a rational case for "irrational" emotions*.

Listen to your inner Sticky, help it grow big and strong, and make it your friend. You'll need time, help from others, maybe a whole change of environment. It's not gonna be easy...

![ANIM & PIC - me & t-rex](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncase/machine/end_4.png)

...but it's gonna be worth it.
